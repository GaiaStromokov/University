# Miller indices for direction
- Defenition
	- A direction index denoted by $h~k~l$ means along the direction of $h*a_{1}+k*a_{2}+l*a_{3}$, again relative too the primitive lattice vectors
- direction $[h~k~l]$ is perpendicular to the $(h~k~l)$ plane because the miller index of the plane is given by reciprocal intercepts
___
# Hydrocarbons
- Polymers are a broad family of organic materials
- based on hydrocarbons
- C has **4** valence electrons that allow up too __ __ Bonds
- C bonding is very versatile
	- Saturated if all bonds are single
	- unsaturated if some bonds are double or triple
	- unsaturated bonds allow additional atoms or molecules to be added
# Polymers: chaining Cs together
- chains of basic building blocks each called mer
- a monomer is a stable molecule that becomes a building block
- this chain reaction (polymerization) requires a catalyst
- ethylene -> polyethylene (TEP)
# Molecular Shape
- Polymer straight chain length
	- $L=Nd\sin(\dfrac{\theta}{2})=2n_{n}d\sin(\dfrac{\theta}{2})$
# Molecular Structure
- depending on how the chains are arranged, polymers can be:
	- linear chains
	- branched
	- cross linked
	- network
