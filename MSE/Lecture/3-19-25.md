# Eutectoid and peritectic reaction
- intermediate solid solutions
	- intermediate phases between end points such as $\beta'$
- eutectoid=eutectic like
	- direct transition from a binary to a unary phase, e.g. point E
- Peritectic
	- one solid phase into a liquid plus another different solid
	- E.g. point P
- Incongruent transofrmation
	- at least one phase changes composition

# Intermetallic compounds
- In some caess, a unique intermediate compound emerges
- different chemical formula
- Has a single phase and only one fixed composition
- not a solid solution
- vertical line in the diagram
