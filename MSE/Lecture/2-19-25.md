# Elastic Deformation: Hooke's Law
- Stress $\sigma$ is the density of force applied too the material $\sigma=\dfrac{F}{A_{0}}$
	- F is the applied force (typically in N)
	- $A_{0}$ is the unstrained/relaxed cross-sectional area
- Strain $\epsilon$ is the response of the material to the force $\epsilon=\dfrac{\Delta t}{t_{0}}=\dfrac{l-l_{0}}{l_{0}}$
	- $l_{0}$ is the relaxed/unstrained length
- Hooke's Law: $\sigma=E * \epsilon$
	- E is the modulus of elasticity $\dfrac{N}{M^2}$
- Units? Range of validity
# Linear vs non-linear behavior
- Elastic: reversible and repeatable
- Linear -- Stress and strain proportional
	- Typical at small amounts of stress/strain
# Bonding and elasticity
- we can zoom in and examine the force F of each bond as a function of displacement
- in the region around the equilibrium distance $r=r_{0}$, the force F is linear in displacement
- We can now relate the modulus of the entire solid to the slope of the bonding force
	- Modulus $E=\dfrac{d\sigma}{d\epsilon}=\dfrac{d(F/A_{0})}{d(l-l_{0})/l_{0}}=\dfrac{l_{0}}{A_{0}} \dfrac{dF}{dl}$
# Temperature
- E generally decreases with temperature
- significant variations in polymers, dependent on cross-linking/crystallinity
# Elastic deformation: torsional stress
- For pure shear, we have shear stress $\tau = \dfrac{F}{A_{0}}$
	- F is the applied force (typically in N)
	- $A_{0}$ is the unstrained/relaxed cross-sectional area
- Shear strain is the responce in terms of angle $\Upsilon=\tan \theta$
# Poisson's ratio
- when a material is under tensile strain, it elongates
- Elongation also causes shrinking in the two perpendicular direction
	- E.g. strain along z causes decrease in x,y length
	- we define strain in x,y similarly 
				- $\epsilon_{x}=\Delta I_{x}/l_{0x}$
				- $l_{x}=l_{0x}(1+e_{x})$
- If strain is only along z and material is isotropic (properties are the same in every direction)
	- $e_{x}=e_{y} \neq e_{z}$
- Poisson's ratio: $v=-\dfrac{\epsilon_{x}}{\epsilon_{z}}=-\dfrac{\epsilon_{y}}{\epsilon_{z}}$
- The elastic, shear moduli and Poisson are related
	- $E=2G(1+v)$
