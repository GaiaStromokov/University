# Strain hardening/cold working
- strain hardening is the phenomenon whereby a ductile metal becomes harder and stronger as it is plastically deformed
- cold work means plastic deformation of a material at room temp
- measured in the reduction of the cross sectional area %$CW=(\dfrac{A_{0}-A_{d}}{A_{0}})*100$
# Grain growth
- elevated temps cancause grains to grow
- growth occurs by atomic diffusion across GB
- growth over time goverened by: $d^n - d^n_{0}=kt$
	- n~2 and k is a temp dependant constant
- Yield strength: $\sigma_{y}=\sigma_{0}+k_{y}d^{-1/2}$
