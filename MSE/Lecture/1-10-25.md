# Electron Configurations:
 - Bohr model predictions $E_{n}=-\dfrac{13.6}{n^2}eV$
 - however, energy splitting between s,p,d,f
 - spin allows 2 electrons per subshell, spin up and spin down
	 - spin isn't literally spin, a property of observation
___
# Periodic table of elements
- table # shows total num of electrons/protons
- Bottom # shows mass in amu=atomic mass units
- 1 amu = 1/12 of mass of 1 C atom
- conversion 1 amu/atom = 1g/mol (1mol=6.023e23 atoms)
___
# The free (isolated) silicon atom
- The isolated Si atom as atomic # 14: 14 total electrons
- The inner 2+8 are core electrons and rarely participate in reactions/conduction
- The outer 4 are valence electrons and they form bonds
- The pauli exclusions principle allows only 1 electron in each "state"
- However, electrons have spin up/down so we can have 2 per sub shell
- SI -> $1s ^{2} ~~ 2s ^{2} ~~2p^{2}~~3s ^{2} ~~ 3p^{2}$
___
### Electron configuration of Ge
- Atomic number 32
- 1s2,2s2,2p6,3s2,3p6,4s2,3d10,4p2
___
# Bonding: overview
- Atoms form bonds in order to minimize the total energy of the combination
- one way to achieve this goal is by sharing electrons
- only the outermost electrons, called valence electrons participate in bonding
- depending on how electrons are shared, we can get 3 types of bonding 
	1. evenly shared by nearest neighbors: covalent bonding
	2. one atom takes most of the electrons: ionic bonding
	3. all electrons shared by all: metallic bonding
## Bonding potential energy and force
- every bond is a balance between repulsive forces Fr and attractive forces Fa
- energy is given by equating potential energy and work $E(r)=\int^\infty_{r}F(r')dr'$
- the total net energy is a sum of repulsive energy $E_{R}$ and attractive energy $E_{A}$
- Bond length is determined by $F_{R}=-F_{A},r=r_{0}$ is the minimum in the potential energy
- Bonding energy is minimized when attractive and repulsive forces balance
