# Fatigue limit (room temp)
- fatigue or endurance limit: largest stress amplitude that will never cause failiure
- not all materials exhibit fatigue limit (b)
- fatigue strength is stress amplitude at some fixed number of cycles
# Creep (static stress, rising temp)
- creep is time dependent and permanent deformation when exposed to static stresses
- for metals, usually observed at temperatures exceeding $0.4*T_{m}$ ($T_{m}$ is melting temp)
- slope of the curve called "steady state creep rate"
# Phase diagrams
- components refer to the pure metals/compounds too which an alloy is composed
- system is a particular body of material or a series of alloys of the same components
	- E.g. the iron-carbon system
- EXAMPLE
	- if we mix sugar and water, the sugar will disolve
		- forms a single sugar-water syrup phase
		- this is a homogenous system
	- if we keep adding sugar, we will reach the solubility limit
		- at this limit the water is saturated with sugar and cannot dissolve any more
		- forms a second solid phase of undissolved sugar at the bottom
		- mixture is now heterogenous
# Equilibrium phase diagram
- plot the phases as functions of temperature and composition (not pressure)
- Copper-nickel system is isomorphous
	- both are FCC and have similar atomic radii
	- below 1085* C they are mutually soluble at all %
- Solid solutions denoted by lower case greek letters $\alpha, \beta, \gamma$
