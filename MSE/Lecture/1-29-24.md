# Impact of molecular weight on properties
- molecular weight and the closely related degree of polymerization impact a host of polymer properties
	- Viscosity - chemical resistance, impact resistance
	- tensile strength increases with MW as chains are entangled better
	- crystallinity - shorter chains (lower degree of polymerization) crystallize more easily but longer chains form larger crystalline regions

#### Crystallinity: $\dfrac{p_{c}(p_{s}-p_{s})}{p_{c}(p_{s}-p_{s})}$


# Chapter 5
- Point defects
	- Can be a vacancy (missing atom), or interstitial (atom inserted into small space between other atoms)
## Point defect density
- The equilibrium density of vacancies depends on their formation energy
$N_{v}=N \exp(-\dfrac{Q_{v}}{kT})=N*e^{-Q_{v}/kT}$
- N is atomic density of host crystal
- $Q_{v}$ is the formation energy of vacancy
- k is boltzmann constant $k=8.262e-5 eV/K$
- NOTE: we can also write the $Q_{v}$ in J and K in J/K
- OR in J/mol and J/mol-k, then we have $N_{v}=N \exp(-\dfrac{Q_{v}}{RT})$ where R is the ideal gas constant $R=8.3145 \dfrac{J}{mol-K}$
