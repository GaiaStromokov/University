# Polymers: mechanical properties vs T
- T causes 
	- Decrease in modulus
	- Decrease in TS
	- Decrease in ductility
- Highly sensitive to T near room temp


# Motion of dislocation
- dislocations are a primary reason why strength of materials is lower then predicted for a perfect crystal
- dislocations can propogate during plastic deformation
- E.g. line dislocation moving in the direction of sheer stress
- the motion of dislocation is termed "slip"
- the plane of motion of the dislocation is called a "slip plane"
- Density of dislocations measured in units of $mm^{-2}$ as:
	- total length of dislocations in a unit volume
	- the number of dislocation lines intersecting a random plane
	- ranges from $10^3~ mm^{-2}$

# Slip systems
- dislocations do not propagate equally in all directions
- tend to propagate along the plane of largest atomic density
- in the slip plane, the propagation has a direction, called "slip direction"
- the direction tends to be the one with greatest linear atomic density
- together the plane and direction are called a slip plane
