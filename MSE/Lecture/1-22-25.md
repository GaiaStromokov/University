# Silicone density
FCC structure: 5 lattice points in each cubic unit cell
lattice constant of $a=5.43A$, $1A=.1nm=1*10^{-8}cm$

$P_{atom}=2* \dfrac{4}{a^3}=\dfrac{8}{5.43*10^{-8}cm}=5*10^{22}cm^{-3}$

# Close packing example
- chromium is a metal with a bcc lattice and one atom basis. what is the packing ratio
1. First figure out how big a sphere we can place
	- if we start in the center, a sphere can extend half way to the corners
	- length of the diagonal is $\dfrac{\sqrt{3}}{2}a$ where a is the lattice constant
	- radius of the largest sphere we can place is $r=\dfrac{\sqrt{3}}{4}a$
	- volume of such a sphere is $V=\dfrac{4}{3}\pi r^3=\dfrac{4}{3}\pi(\dfrac{\sqrt{3}}{4}a)^3=\dfrac{4}{3}\pi  \dfrac{3}{}$
