# Stress Concentration
- Materials typically contain microscopic flaws
- stress increases at the edges of cracks
- can also occur at corners and notches
___
1. what is the main direction of crack propagation
	1. cracks propogate horionztally
___
# Critical Stress
- Critical stress is the stress2 required for propogation of cracks in brittle material
	- $\sigma_{c}=\sqrt{\dfrac{2Ey_{s}}{\pi a}}$
- Here $Y_{s}$ is the specific surgace energy (in $J/m^2=N/m$) and E is>
- can rearrange this equation too solve for a in order to determine larges crack size allowed for a given range of stress
	- $a=\dfrac{2Ey_{s}}{\pi \sigma^2_{c}}$
	- 2*a for full length
# Fracture toughness
- fracture toughness is a measure of a material's resistance to brittle fracture in the (inevitable) presense of cracks
	- $K_{c}=Y\sigma_{c}\sqrt{\pi a}$
- here Y is a unitless geometric factor
- the value of Y is close too unity
- Y=1 for a thick plate with through crack
- Y=1.1 for an edge crack
- $K_{c}$ has unusual units $\dfrac{N}{m^{3/2}}$
