# Diffusion
- all solids store and conduct thermal energy in the form of lattice vibrators called phonons
	- these are vibrations of atoms around their equilibrium positions
	- atoms are not static, they are always in motion
- Occasionally the atomic vibrator allow atoms to break bonds and migrate from their equilibrium position in the crystal
- for diffusion too occur an empty site has too be available
	- electrons in metals and semi conductors also diffuse in a similar way
	- ions in polymers can also diffuse
- Atoms move from higher concentration too lower concentration
- after 2 materials mix, the concentration gradient gets smaller

___
# Types of diffusion in solids
- diffusion of vacancies (moving from 1 vacancy too another)
- diffusion of interstitial (diffusion of interstitials)
# Ficks first law - derivation
- the net number of atoms crossing the plane of observation at L=0 will be
- $N=-N_{RL}+N_{LR}=-\dfrac{[n(L)-n(-L)]v_{th}A(t)}{2}$
- $M=-\dfrac{[n(L)-n(-L)]v_{th}A(t)}{2}$
- Diffusion flux density
	- $J=-D \dfrac{dc}{dx}$ in 1D, while in 3D: $J=-D\vec{V}C$
	- diffusion cooef has units of $\dfrac{m^2}{s}$
- Temp dependance of diffusion coefficient
	- $D=D_{0}\exp(-\dfrac{Q_{d}}{kT})$ if 
### Example: 
$k=8.62*10^{-5}$ eV/K
$R=8.31$ j/mol-K
$D=D_{0}e^{-Q_{d}/kT}$
$D_{0}=2.3*10^{-5}$
$Q_{d}= 80 kJ/mol,1.53eV/atom$

(6.2*10^{-7})e^{\frac{-80000}{8.31\cdot\left(700+273\right)}}
