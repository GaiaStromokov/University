# Chapter 2: Intro to Atomic Structure and Bonding
## Overview
- Understand materials, the atoms they are composed of and how they bond
- Briefly introduce quantum mechanics
- Discuss orbitals and electron configurations
- Concept of orbitals and electron-configs to understand bonding
- Different types of bonding that allow atoms to form solids


## Bohr model of the atom
- Bohr concluded that light can only be absorbed if it satisfies
	- $\Delta E=hw=hf=\dfrac{hc}{\lambda_{light}}$
- Where $\Delta E$ is the difference in energy between 2 orbitals
- This allowed bohr to map out the optical transition
___
- De Broglie: the electron in an orbital is a standing wave!
- It has a wavelength equal too the orbit length: $n\lambda=2\pi R$ (n is an int)
- Using the de Broglie Hypothesis $p=hk=\dfrac{h}{\lambda}=\dfrac{nh}{2\pi R}$ (k is the wave number)
- Angular momentum takes discrete steps L = Rp = nh
	- H is the planck's constant $h=6.626*10^{-34}Js=4.132*10^{-15}eVs$
	- The h-bar is the reduced Planck's constant $h=\dfrac{h}{2\pi}$
- From this it follows that each orbital has energy
	- $E_{n}=-\dfrac{m_{o}q^4}{2(4\pi\epsilon_{0}hn)^2}=-\dfrac{13.6}{n^2}eV$
	- eV stands for electron volt and is a unit of energy
## Electron as a classical particle versus wave
- If the electron were a classical particle (ball with mass m and charge -q)
	- the penalty we have to pay to get the electron moving is U, which is the potential energy term
	- once it is free to move, it would have a momentum p=mv
	- kinetic energy would related to it's speed/momentum p=mv as
		- $E_{K}=\dfrac{1}{2}m\vec{v}^2=\dfrac{\vec{p}^2}{2m}$
	- it's total energy would be the sum of kinetic and potential $E(p)=E_{K}+U=\dfrac{p^2}{2m}+U$
- If instead we think of the electron as a wave, we need a wave function
	- $\Psi(x,t)=Ae^{i(k_{x}x-wt)}$
	- A=amplitude, w=angular frequency=$2\pi f$ (f is number of oscillations per second), k=wavevector: counts number of wave nodes per unit distance along the direction of propagation, $\lambda$ = wavelength: special length of 1 full cycle of the wave
## Schrodinger's Equation
- the SE defines the wavefunction $\Psi$ up to a constant
- interpret the wavefunction as it's modulus $\Psi*\Psi=|\Psi|^2$ is probability distribution function of finding the electron in an interval dx around x
- probability of finding the electron anywhere in space has to be 1
- this is called normalization and is needed to uniquely define the wave function:
- 1D: $\int^\infty_{-\infty} \Psi*\Psi=1$
- 3D: $\int \int \int \Psi*\Psi ~~d\bar{r}=1$
- the wavefunction has to be continuous (otherwise it's derivative would be infinite)
## Hydrogen atom according to Schrodinger
 - Take the electrostatic potential of the electron-proton interaction
	 - $U(r)=\dfrac{q^2}{4\pi \epsilon_{0}r}$
- Plug this into the Schrodinger equation
	- $-\dfrac{h^2}{2m} \dfrac{d^2\Psi(r,t)}{dx^2}+(U(r)-E)\Psi(\vec{r})=0$
- Solve for the wavefunctions $\Psi(\vec{r})$
- what do the wavefunctions mean
- $P_{ab}=\int^b_{a}\Psi*(x)\Psi(x)dx$ so the square of the wavefunction tells us about the probability of the electron being in some interval
