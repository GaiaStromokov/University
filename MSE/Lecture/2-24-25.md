# Plastic Deformation
- permanent, nonrecoverable
- Macroscopic picture: decrease in modulus
- Microscopic picture: breaking of bonds, slip
- point P sometimes called "proportional limit"
- Yielding=onset of plastic deformation
- Convention:
	- 0.002 offset (parallel) method
	- Determines "yield strength" $\sigma_{y}$
- Nonlinear materials:
	- typically use 0.005 strain instead of offset method
# Tensile Strength and fracture
- Tensile strength
	- TS=stress at the peak of the curve
	- maximum stress
- Below TS
	- plastic deformation uniform
- Above TS: necking
- Fracture = end of the curve
- Structure breaks at the neck
# Ductility
- Measure of plastic deformation at fracture
- brittle if fracture strain less then $5$%
- Percent elongation % $EL=(\dfrac{l_{f}-I_{0}}{l_{0}})*100$
	- $l_{f}$ is the length at fracture
	- usually use 2 inch length as the standard length
- Percent reduction in area %$RA=(\dfrac{A_{0}-A_{f}}{A_{0}})*100$
	- $A_{f}$ is the area at fracture
# Resilience
- Capacity to absorb energy during elastic deformation
- Absorbed energy can be released
	- think springs - store energy when compressed/expanded
- $U_{f}=$ modulus of resiliance = area under curve
	- $u_{r}=\int^{\epsilon_{y}}_{0} \sigma ~d\epsilon$
- if the elastic region is linear, then approximately
	- $U_{r} = \dfrac{1}{2}\sigma_{y}\epsilon_{y}=\dfrac{1}{2} \dfrac{\sigma^2_{y}}{E}$
- Q: what combination of yield strength and modulus would we want for a spring

# True stress and strain
- Cross-sectional area reduses with tensile strain
- True stress is based on the instantaneous area $A_{i}$ instead of $A_{0}$
	- $\sigma_{T}=\dfrac{F}{A_{i}}$
- we represent true strain as the integral of incremental engineering strain
	- $\epsilon_{T}=\int^{l_{i}}_{l_{0}} \dfrac{dt}{t}=\ln(\dfrac{l_{i}}{l_{0}})=\ln(1+e)$
- true and engineering stress/strain related by
	- $\sigma_{T}=\sigma(1+\epsilon)$
- the above eqn is exact when volume is constant
- important point: true stress increases beyond TS
# True stress - strain,contd
- for some metals and alloys we have a relatively simple eqn.
	- $\sigma_{T}=K(\epsilon_{t})^n$
