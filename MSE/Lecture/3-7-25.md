	- Macroscopic: characteristics of the system do not change over time; system is stable
- Microscopic: dividing the syst4em into sub systems does not alter their properties
	- detailed balance - every microscopic process has an equal and opposite process
- Thermodynamics: Helmholtz free energy $A=U-TS$ (or Gibbs free energy $G=H-TS=U+pV-ST$) is minimized
	- U is the total internal potential energy of the system (p is pressure, v is volume)
	- T is absolute temperature and s is the entropy, a measure of the randomness of it's configuration
	- change in temperature or pressure will result in non equilibrium untill free energy is minimized
- Meta stable - out of equilibrium but the rate of approach to equilibrium is slow
	- microstructure is stable, experiencing only slight and almost imperceptible changes over time
	- amorphous glass is metastable with properties over very long time scales
___
# Tie line
- "Tie Line" a horizontal line at a fixed temperate ("isotherm")
- connects the solidus and liquidus lines
- the point B denotes a specific Alloy
	- Composition of this alloy is $C_{0}$
	- Held at a specific temperate T
- At the point B, we have a mix of $\alpha+L$
	- $\alpha$ is the solid phase, L denotes the liquid
	- the point where tie line intersects the liquidus gives us the composition of liquid $C_{1}$
	- Intersection of tie line with solidus gives us the composition of the solid phase $C_{\alpha}$
- $C_{L}$ and $C_{\alpha}$ represent compositions in each respective phase
___
# Lever rule
- The phase diagram and tie line give us the composition of phases
- what about the relative percentages of each phase at a point?
	- E.g. want to know what gfraction of the mixture at point B vs what fraction is solid
- Level rule says that relative weight percent of each component equals relative length on tie line
	- R denotes the segment of tie line from B to liquidus
	- % of liquid equals $S/(R+S)$
		- $W_{L}=\dfrac{S}{R+S}= \dfrac{C_{\alpha}-c_{0}}{C_{\alpha}-C_{L}}$
	- Analogously, % solid $(\alpha)$ is $R/(R+S)$
		- $W_{\alpha}=\dfrac{R}{R+S}$
___
# Lever rule cont
- going back to fundementals, we know that the sum must equal 1: $W_{L}+W_{a}=1$
- we also know that the total composition must equal the composition of the alloy
	- $W_{L}C_{L}=W_{\alpha}C_{\alpha}=C_{0}$
___
# Binary Eutectic diagrams
- "solvus" -- solid solubility limit seperating single phase from 2 phase regions
- Melting temperature lowered by additions along liquidus line
- Point E is the "Invariant point"
- Starting at $C_{t}$ and heating produces a direct transition too liquid
- Called eutectic reaction
- the horizontal line through $T_{e}$ is called eutective isotherm
