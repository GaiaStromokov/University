# Crystal Structure
## Crystal = Lattice * Basis
- A crystal is composed of a superposition of Lattice and basis
	- Lattice: a set of periodically repeating points in space
	- Basis: collection of all the atoms repeated at each lattice point
- Basis is a basic lego cube building block of crystal, the lattice is where you place the basis
## The crystal Lattise:
- We describe the lattice as a collection of regularly spaced points
- Think of a vector R which connects any pair of lattice points
- each such vector R can be composed of an integer combination of "Primitive lattice vectors"
		$\bar{R}=n_{1}\vec{a}_{1}+n_{2}\vec{a}_{2}+n_{3}\vec{a}_{3}$
- The primitive lattice vectors connect nearest neighbors in the lattice
- we can "reach" and point in the lattice moving by primitive lattice vectors
- they are NOT unique
	- PRIMITIVE: point a to point b, grid point too grid point
	- NON-PRIMITIVE: vector movement
## Primitive Unit Cell(s):
- a "primitive unit cell" (PUC) is the smallest space (area/volume) bordered by the primitive lattice vectors.
- "Contains" exactly one lattice point! one-to-one mapping LP $\to$ PUC
- Can construct the entire crystal by "tiling" it with non-over/under lapping PUC's
- the choice of PUC is not unique
- PRIMITIVE = square/no points inside
- NON-PRIMITIVE=Surrounds points
___
## Wigner-Seitz Unit Cells(s)
- One way to uniquely define a primitive unit cell is the Wigner-Seitz cell
- It is obtained by bisecting the lines between nearest neighbor points
- WS unit cell is the smallest area/volume contained after the bisection process
