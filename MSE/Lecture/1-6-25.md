# Why MSE
- New and improved materials have been the driving force of innovation
	- Semiconductors: LED, PV panels
	- Organic Materials: Polymers
	- Magnetics: efficient Electric Motors
	- Die-electric: Supercapacitors, batteries

- New experimental tools enable us too see atoms
	- Atomic scale imaging using scanning tunneling microscope
	- Atomic force microscope allows us too "see" surfaces
- New computational tools: quantum mechanics and AI
# About
1. Understand how atomic bonding is related too modulus, melting point, thermal expansion
2. differentiate between amorphous and crystalline materials on the basis of x-ray diffraction and crystallinity
3. predict diffusion in solids and understand how this is thermally activated
4. understand how thermodynamics and kinetics combine too control the processing of advanced materials
5. apply thermodynamics in understanding phase equilibria
6. gain a understanding of what controls the electrical optical and thermal behavior of materials, and
7. be able to understand fundamental design considerations for materials selection.
# At the dawn of time
- Vacuum tubes
- invented 1904 by John Ambrose Fleming
- Diodes, triodes, pentodes, miniatures
- still used for extreme environments
- or by audiophiles

# Logistics
# Lecture: 
MWF 11:50-12:40 in HEB 2004
- Not required, but you should
# Office Hours:
MW 4-5 in CME 210
Discussions and Q&A, use Piazza

# Textbook and reading
Reading summaries at the end of each chapter, submit 1 handwritten page, it should address these 3 questions (paragraph each)
- what was covered (summary and key ideas)
- why the content of the chapter is important too your knowledge of MSE
- what you found most interesting

# Problem Sets
- at the end of each chapter there is a Problem Set
- Mix of Plug and Chug and multi part
- they will take 6-10 hours too complete
- 8-9 problem sets in total
- problem set questions are similar in style too exams
- after exam, you add corrections
- Drop the lowest 1
# Grading
- Participation is 20%
