# Point defect density
- the equilibrium density of vacancies depends on their formation energy
	$N_{v}=Ne^{-Q_{v}/kT}$

### TPS:
$e=4.0$ eV
$Density=5*10^{22}$ cm^-3
$k=8.62*10^{-5}$
$N_{v}=5*10^{22}*e^{\frac{-4}{8.62*10^{-5}*300}}=3.3320847298\times10^{-45}$
___
Stone-Thrower-Wales defects
- change in bonding of C atoms
- results in change from hexagons to 5 or 7 atom rings
- common in graphene/graphite, carbon nanotubes
___
# Impurities
- the addition of other atomic species too form a solid solution
	- Crystal structure is generally maintained, apart from point deviations
	- no additional/secondary phases are created
- Substitutional impurity
	- Impurity atom replaces host
	- depends on compatibility
		- Atomic size
		- Crystal structure of host vs impurity
		- valences
- Interstitial Impurity
- Impurity occupies the small empty space between host atoms
___
# Dislocations
- a linear defect is a continuouse 1-D line of imperfections/vacancies
- Represented by a burgers vector $\vec{b}$
	- Direction and magnitude of dislocation
- Edge dislocation
	- atomic plane terminates
- Screw dislocation
	- atomic planes circle around a helix
___
# Interfacial defects
- Surfaces (2D) of imperfections seperating 2 different crystal structures
	- External surgace of a crystal seperating two different crystal structures
___
# Grain Boundaries
- surfaces seperating crystaline regions of different orientation
- low angle
	- small relative rotation of crystals
