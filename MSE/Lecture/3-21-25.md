# Kinetics: transformation rate
- Two steps:
	1. Nucleation: formation of small (submicron) particles of the new phase
	2. Growth: the nuclei increase in size
- Kinetics described by avrami equation
	$\gamma=1-\exp(-kt^n)$
	$\gamma$ is the fraction of transformation
	k and n are time independent constants (but depend on t)
	- Rate of transformation to get too $\gamma=0.5$
		$r=\dfrac{1}{t_{0.5}}$

# Rate versus temperature
- the rate is thermally activated
	$r=Ae^{-Q/kT}$ or $r=Ae^{-Q/RT}$
	- Q is the activation energy
	- K is the boltzmann constant and r is the gas constant
