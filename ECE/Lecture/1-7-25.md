___
## Common circuit elements
![[Table_1-3.png]]
## Current

## Kirchoff's Current Law
1.  write all known values
2. keep track of unknown values
3. write all KCL(loop) equations
	- each loop must pick up at least 1 new element
4. apply ohms law
5. apply as many KCL (node) equations as needed too fill in unknowns
	- each KCL equation must pick up at least 1 new current
6. solve for unknowns
### Ohms Law: $I=\dfrac{V}{R}$, $V=\dfrac{I}{R}$, $R=\dfrac{V}{I}$
## Circuits
- Ordinary node
	- connection between 2 elements => same branch
- Extraordinary node
	- connection with more then 2 elements
