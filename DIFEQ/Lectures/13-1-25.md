# 1.4: Seperatable equations and applications
## The first order DE is called separable if $f(x,y)$ can be written as the product of a function of x and a function of y.
$\dfrac{dy}{dx}=f(x,y) = g(x)*h(y)$
## Steps
1. Separate the x's and y's by the equals sign this includes separating the differentials dx and dy as well
2. integrate both sides with the given differential
3. try to obtain an explicit expression for $y(x)$
