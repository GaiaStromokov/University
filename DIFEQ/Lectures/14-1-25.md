# Do we obtain all possible solutions this way
### Example: consider $\dfrac{dy}{dx}=6xy$ then $y(x)=0$ is a solution
1. $\dfrac{dy}{dx}=\dfrac{d}{dx}(0)=0$
2. $6xy=6*x *0=0$
3. $\dfrac{dy}{dx}=0=6xy$
## So what happened? why did we miss this solution:
- When we separated the DE we divided both sides by y so we implicitly assumed that $y\neq 0$
# Consider the 1st order DE:
$\dfrac{dy}{dx}=g(x)*h(y)$ which we solve by sep of vars
$\int \dfrac{1}{h(y)}dy=\int g(x)dx=G(x)=0$
==If== $y^*$ is a value for which $h(y^{*})=0$ then $y(x)=y^{x}$ is an equilibrium solution for the DE since $\dfrac{dy}{dx}(y^{x})=0$ and equivalently $g(x)*h(y^{x})=0$
==If== there is no constant C for which $G(x)+C=y^{x}$ then $y(x)=y^{x}$ is called a singular solution
### Example: Find all solutions to $\dfrac{dy}{dx}=6x(y-1)^{2/3}$
1. $\dfrac{1}{(y-1)^{2/3}}dy=6xdx$
2. $\int \dfrac{1}{(y-1)^{2/3}}dy=\int 6xdx$
3. $3(y-1)^{1/3}=3x^2+C$
4. $(y-1)^{1/3}=x^2+C_{1}$
5. $y-1=(x^2+c_{1})^2$
6. $y(x)=1+(x^{2}+c_{1})^{3}$
7. $1=1+(x^{2}+c_{2})^3$
8. $0=(x^2+c_{1})^3$
9. $x^{2}+c_{1}=0$
10. $c_{1}=-x^{2}$
11. No value of c makes this function equal to 1, so y=1 is a singular solution
#### What if we missed the singular solution and looked for the particular solution too $\dfrac{dy}{dx}=6x(y-1)^{2/3}$, $y(0)=1$
- we would find
1. $y(x)=1+(x^{2}+c_{1})^3$
2. $1=1+c_{1}^3$
3. $0=c_{1}^{3} \to c_{1}=0$
4. So we do not have a unique solution cause not continuous at y=1, so not guaranteed a unique solution

Let F represent the pop of a species. Let's assume this population has a constant birth and death rate denotes by ==B== and ==S== representatively.
