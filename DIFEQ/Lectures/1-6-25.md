# Differential Equations:
An equation that relates an unknown function too one or more of it's derivatives.
==EX:==$\dfrac{dx}{dt}=x^2+t^2$
# Why do we care:
Things change with time, it's easy too describe that change

# Is my coffee going to be too cold too drink by the end of this lecture
Change in temp = (Temp gradient) * (How fast material conducts heat) * (*Time passed)
T=Coffee Temp, A=Ambient temp, K=constant
1. $\dfrac{dT}{dt}=k(T-A)$
2. $\dfrac{dT}{(T-A)}=-k~dt$
3. $\int \dfrac{dT}{T-A}=\int -k~dt$
4. $T-A=e^{-kt+c}$
5. $T=A+e^c~e^{-kt}$
6. $T=A + Be^{-kt}$
7. $T=A+(T_{0}-A)e^{-kt}$
8.
