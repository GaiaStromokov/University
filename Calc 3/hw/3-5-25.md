The temperature at $(x,y,z)$ of a solid sphere centered at the origin is $T(x,y,z)=100e^{-(x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2})}$. Note that it is hottest at the origin, Show that the direction of the greatest decrease in temperature is always a vector pointing away from the origin

# 21
Find the gradient of $f(x,y,z)=\sin \sqrt{x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2}}$. Show that the gradient always points directly toward the origin or directly away from the origin

# 26
If the temperature of a plate at the point $(x,y)$ is $T(x,y)=10+x^{2}-y^{2}$, find the path of a heat seeking particle (which always moves in the direction of greatest increase in temperature) would follow if it starts at $(-2,1)$. *Hint:* The particle moves in the direction of the gradient $\nabla T=2xi-2yj$
we may write the path in the paramentric from as
$r(t)=x(t)i+y(t)j$
and we want $x(0)=-2$ and $y(0)=1$. to move in the required direction means that $r'(t)$ should be parallel to $\nabla T$ this will be satisfied if $\dfrac{x'(t)}{2x(t)}=- \dfrac{y'(t)}{2y(t)}$ together with the conditions $x(0)=-2$ and $y(0)=1$. Now solve this differential equation and evaluate the arbitrary constant of integration
